Thie is a Simple Solution to the Coin Change Problem written in **Ruby** (Rspec):

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem and
- http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Coin_Change

This an **ultra basic** Computer Science problem that I just never 
(bothered to) solve by writing code...
Conceptually, its obvious, but actually *using* the (Programming) Language 
to solve it is a surprisingly good (almost therapeutic) exercise.

Summary of the problem:

a) Given an input **amount** of Money

b) Return the *smallest number of coins* that for the amount (as an *array*)

e.g. if we *input* **6** (cents)
should get **One Nicle** (5 Cents) *and* **One Cent**
or in **array** format **[5,1]**


The way we "*test*" the returned amount using **Rspec** by writing a Unit Test:

  it "returns [5, 1] for 6" do
    expect(subject.change(6)).to eq [5,1]
  end

Explanation: we are saying **it** (the function/method) will return a **result [5,1]** for **input 6**
then we write an "*Expectation*" to test this.
**subject** is a *shorthand* for calling the *Class* **Change**. 
We can do this becaue we *described* the group of tests as **Change** above (*describe Change do*)
this means we are testing the Change *Class* in our Unit tests.
So when we call *subject.change* we are indireclyt calling the Change.chage method.

To run this script from the command line simply issue the command:

    $ rspec change_spec.rb

( note you will need to have **ruby** and **rspec** *installed* on your machine for this to work )


I solved using a couple of different approaches. 

The solution in **change_spec.rb** is elegant and simple to understand.

The only "complexity" is the .inject(:+) method which adds the items in the coins array together 
to do a quick-sum check and subtract this *running total* of coins from the original amount.

Alternative Solutions:
- Two (separate) methods: https://gist.github.com/4570492
- Two Nested Until Loops (recursive): https://gist.github.com/4570556
- One .each Loop, Subtraction AND Division (a bit fancier): https://gist.github.com/4570709
- 5 - Liner (compressed method to single line - unmaintainable!): https://gist.github.com/4570855
